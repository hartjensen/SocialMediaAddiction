# Analysis of Social Media Addiction in Students

## <ins> Determining Negative Impacts of Student Life due to Social Media Addiction </ins>

[This dataset](/SSMAddiction.csv) contains the results from surveying students on their social media usage. There are about 800 rows, and 13 columns that include numerical and categorial entries. Some of the data collected is time spent on social media, which platforms they prefer, and whether or not they report conflicts in their relationships. I'm interested in which areas of life are most negatively impacted by an excess of social media consumption. I'd also like to see if those who report being addicted to social media are more likely to use the same apps.
